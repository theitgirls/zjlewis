            LaNaia Jones is the chief information officer of the CIA as of this year. She was recently appointed to this position from her former position of being a Potomac Officers Club speaker. She is a veteran leader in the Information Community. She has a master’s degree in technology management and a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Maryland. Jones' contributions are not only important to the STEM community, but also to the many underrepresented women of color in the field.

        <h3>My Teachable Machine</h3>

            During today's class, we learned about teachable machines and created our own with a partner. I worked with Maddy and created a teachable machine that would recognize our faces and when nobody was there. Our idea behind it was that it could be used for opening doors on campus when the machine recognized a student standing in front of it.
