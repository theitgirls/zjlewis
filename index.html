        <p>
            Hey everyone! My name is <strong>Zaria</strong> and I am a rising senior at Jamesville-DeWitt High School in Jamesville, NY. I decided to take this class because I want to major in engineering and I have always been interested in computer science. I thought this class would be a nice introduction. I love to build things, especially the problem-solving aspect of it. Outside of school I play the cello and I like a good horror film.

            I am looking forward to meeting everyone!
